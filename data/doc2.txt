The Theory of Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It consists of two main parts: Special Relativity and General Relativity. Special Relativity introduced the idea that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light is constant. General Relativity, on the other hand, describes gravity not as a force but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory has been confirmed by many experiments, including the observation of gravitational waves.
