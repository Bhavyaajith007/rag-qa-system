The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, located in the Coral Sea off the coast of Queensland, Australia. It is composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching over 2,300 kilometers. The reef is home to a vast diversity of marine life, including hundreds of species of fish, coral, mollusks, and marine mammals. It is considered one of the seven natural wonders of the world and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. However, the reef is under threat from climate change, ocean acidification, overfishing, and pollution.
